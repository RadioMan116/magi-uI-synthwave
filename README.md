# Synthwave-x-Flouromachine - Jetbrains (port)
Some time ago I fell in love with the Synthwave-X-Fluoromachine theme available for **VSCode** (https://github.com/webrender/synthwave-x-fluoromachine). I wasn't able to find an equivalent theme available for JetBrains products. As a result I have ported the theme over to JetBrains (IDEA Specifically, but should work with most if not all flavors of Jetbrains products)

## Notes
- This theme has been Tested with IDEA using the following languages:
  - Lua
  - TypeScript
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JSON
- I have not tested it with any other languages, but I will be adding support for more languages as I use them.
- I used to also support Material Theme UI and custom colors there, I have since stopped using Material Theme UI as it feels bloated and is no longer 100% freeware.
- If you are looking for a UI Theme that goes well with this theme, check out the [Prpl Theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12861-prpl-theme)

## Installation Instructions (Manual)
